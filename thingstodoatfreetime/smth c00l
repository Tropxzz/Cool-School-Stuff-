If you're on a Windows computer and the command prompt is not block open the command prompt and type “shutdown -i”
this brings up a shutdown window.
IF the computer your on is in a domain you should see all the computers in that domain in the drop down.
Now select the computer and you can shut down, restart and some other stuff at your will.

If your computer has Command Prompt disabled tho I suggest you learn the Windows scripting language VBS
Its a VERY easy scripting language to learn.
With VBS you can do funny but harmless stuff like make a text game or if your tower/laptop has a CD drive make it open and close repeatedly,
stuff like that.
